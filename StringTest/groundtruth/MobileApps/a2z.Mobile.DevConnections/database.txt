This discussion will focus less on offering prescriptive guidance and more on helping the attendee understand some of the potential trade-offs that alternate implementation approaches can provide.":1,"Developers don't read documentation. This is a fact. It is also a fact that an API that depends on its documentation to get developers to understand and discover its features is at a huge disadvantage in the marketplace. Fortunately, there are some simple, easy-to-use mechanisms for wrapping complex APIs and making their functionality both easy to use and highly discoverable. Imagine being able to use tools like IntelliSense that the Visual Studio IDE already provides as a way to expose the functionality of your service or library.

This includes leveraging everything from source code analysis and JavaScript unit testing to UI and performance testing.  Don't miss this session to learn a multitude ways to significantly improve the quality of your web development.":1,"You’re agile. You write user stories. Now what? The next step is often to turn those user stories into executable tests that can help you validate the proper behavior of your complex software systems. Behavior-driven development (BDD) is the engine that can help drive this process in your project. In this session, we'll begin with a series of simple user stories and demonstrate how the BDD process supports codifying them into a series of \"executable specifications\" that can be used to validate the proper functionality of a complex software system. At first, we'll work without the overhead of so-called \"BDD Frameworks\" to demonstrate the important BDD concepts, but then we'll investigate how and when you might use various \"BDD Frameworks\" to offload some of the repetitive work often involved in the BDD process. Attendees should expect to leave with a good understanding of the BDD conceptual process and some of the technical practices that can help support its successful adoption.":1,"When you scale your applications, distributed cache is a must-have tool. Windows Azure Caching is the newest dedicated distributed cache solution for Azure, but it’s not the only option.

It will also cover how to get started with Git, how to set up a repository, and the tools that are available to you.":1,"Mobile development is a hot item. Customers are buying iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and many other mobile computing devices at an ever-increasing record pace. Devices based on iOS and Android constitute more than 90% of the marketplace. RIM continues to be dominant in the business area across the world. With Windows Phone, Nokia will grow on a worldwide basis. At the same time, web development is clearly a tremendous driver of applications, both on the public Internet and on private networks. How can developers target these various mobile platforms with web technologies? Developers can write web applications that take advantage of each mobile platform, but that is a lot of work. This session will provide an overview of mobile web development with HTML5 and ASP.NET.":1,"Many developers cringe at the thought of inheriting and maintaining someone else's code base, particularly if that code base consists of large, complex classes and methods with little separation of concerns. It can be difficult to apply the principles of clean code and to write effective unit tests when you inherit code that is  difficult to test. In this session, I will show you strategies for working with, maintaining, testing, and refactoring legacy code. You will learn how to explore a complex code base and how to refactor it in order to make it more maintainable and testable.":1,"The landscape for Visual Studio developers is changing rapidly. If you haven't been asked to write a mobile app yet, you soon will be. This session will tell you what steps you can take to begin making the move to mobile apps, regardless of whether you'll be developing for Windows Store, Windows Phone, iOS, or Android. This session will also give you the tools to assess your current code base, arm you with strategies to prepare your existing .NET code base for mobilization, and help you start writing mobile-ready C# today.":1,"Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) represents a fundamental shift in how we look at architecting complex software solutions. It suggests that decomposition of complex systems into (relatively) narrowly focused isolated subsystems with carefully considered discrete responsibilities is the best way to manage complexity and achieve scalability. But CQRS has come under fire from its critics, who say that it introduces needless complexity to solve what are otherwise simple problems. Which is it? Perhaps both. In this session, we’ll take a look at understanding CQRS as a set of fundamental design principles and explore common implementation patterns used to translate these principles into practice. Along the way, we’ll demystify terms like event sourcing, read-models, command-handlers, write-only domain models, message buses, and more. We’ll explore all of these in the context of a working CQRS-based system that demonstrates these concepts in action.":1,"Microsoft Test Manager helps testers define and execute system test cases. These tests can be executed as exploratory and scripted test cases, and you can use action recording to manually replay test cases in the future. But it doesn’t stop there!

Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) make it easy to capture and analyze the file and wait statistical information that's automatically provided by the SQL Server instance—so why not use them? In this session, we will explore how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which SQL Server performance bottlenecks are causing the most harm. This knowledge should be part of every DBA's arsenal—so come make it part of yours as well.":1,"An interval represents a set of values between some low and some high values. In reality, there are different kinds of intervals that you might need to represent in your database, such as temporal (e.g., sessions, appointments, periods of validity). To represent temporal intervals in SQL Server, most people use two attributes holding the lower and upper points in time. You also might need to detect relations between intervals, such as overlap (e.g., \"return all contracts that were active during an input period represented by the inputs @lower and @upper\"). Some of the classic querying methods that are used to provide answers for such requests suffer from fundamental optimization problems. This session explains the existing optimization problems, presents solutions for those problems that can be applied in SQL Server, and describes the potential for additions to SQL Server that could improve interval treatment in the future.":1,"Securing your data is becoming increasingly important for data professionals. This session will cover the encryption features available in SQL Server to help you better secure data.

It suggests that decomposition of complex systems into (relatively) narrowly focused isolated subsystems with carefully considered discrete responsibilities is the best way to manage complexity and achieve scalability. But CQRS has come under fire from its critics, who say that it introduces needless complexity to solve what are otherwise simple problems. Which is it? Perhaps both. In this session, we’ll take a look at understanding CQRS as a set of fundamental design principles and explore common implementation patterns used to translate these principles into practice. Along the way, we’ll demystify terms like event sourcing, read-models, command-handlers, write-only domain models, message buses, and more. We’ll explore all of these in the context of a working CQRS-based system that demonstrates these concepts in action.":1,"Microsoft Test Manager helps testers define and execute system test cases. These tests can be executed as exploratory and scripted test cases, and you can use action recording to manually replay test cases in the future. But it doesn’t stop there! Coded UI Tests can help your teams leverage manual test cases by automating them. They can then be executed as part of your builds.In the session, we'll cover how to:• Create a test plan and test cases• Create an action recording for a test case• Convert a test case recording into a Coded UI Test• Add assertions to the Coded UI Test (associate the Coded UI Test to a test case in Microsoft Test Manager)• Execute the test cases automatically":1,"Caching is a key technology for improving application performance and scale.

This session will feature demonstrations of creating virtualized applications using App-V, generating custom settings templates for UE-V, and deploying and managing App-V and UE-V with Active Directory Domain Services.":1,"Server 2012 comes with a real treasure trove of useful new tools, but none of those tools are of any value if you don't know how to install them, start them up, and point them where you want them to go. Setup has changed little, but then there's the \"Core or not?\" question. In 2012, though, the next question is \"So does Server 2012 have a GUI at all?\" The answer is \"Sure...four GUIs in fact, counting Server Core.\" There's still something called Server Manager, but it's completely different from the Server Managers we've seen since Windows Server 2003 SP1.The biggest change in server management is, however, not the all-new Server Manager. That title has to go to the tenfold increase in PowerShell tools. And from that point, there's the constant need to keep an eye on things and tweak what needs tweaking. With 2012, though, there are so many more ways to keep things running, and who better to explain those things than Windows expert and bestselling author Mark Minasi.":1,"Cloud Computing has taken center stage in recent years.

In this session, we will cover the key areas to monitor regarding the database, server, and hardware to get the biggest bang for your buck. See how a little bit of effort up front can lead to a much better understanding of your database environment and put you in a great position to spot potential issues before they become real trouble. Each of the scripts and demos can be utilized immediately in your own environment. You will come away with a fundamental understanding of the most common bottlenecks affecting SQL Server performance and have a much better foothold on tackling the issues that you find.":1,"As a DBA or database developer, you typically undergo a number of learning phases when it comes to new T-SQL features. You usually start by learning the logical aspects of the feature, then practical uses and optimization. With time, you identify best practices, discover more advanced aspects of optimization, and find more creative ways to use the feature. The more experience you have with a feature, the more interesting uses you discover. Great examples are the APPLY operator and the ROW_NUMBER function. The newer the feature, the more discoveries that are still being realized. Good examples are the new and enhanced window functions. This seminar covers querying and query tuning enhancements in the latest major releases of SQL Server concerning new T-SQL features such as window functions, sequences, OFFSET/FETCH, MERGE, grouping sets, date and time types and functions, APPLY, pivoting and unpivoting, CTEs, indexing improvements, and others.":1,"When it comes to SQL Server, one of the biggest requests you hear is \"How can I make my queries run faster?\" The first step in that process is understanding the Query Optimizer—which begins with knowing the rules.

This session will demonstrate how to manage SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server Core and will provide PowerShell scripts to help you perform common Server Core tasks.":1,"Some aspects of building out a BI solution are quite tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you'll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse schema requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional and tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there's a better, faster way! In this session, we explore lessons learned from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We walk through decision points in the framework design, review implementation steps, and demonstrate the ease with which you can make iterative changes to the design of your BI solution. Whether you simply want to accelerate your change management process or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.":1,"In this demo-packed session, we will explore the use of SysInternals tools such as Process Monitor, Process Explorer, and many others to troubleshoot various problem scenarios with SQL Server. This session isn't for the faint of heart and is tailored toward those adventurous DBAs who often like to step out of their comfort zone. A fair knowledge of Windows OS internals is recommended.":1,"You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn't it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you'll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mockups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. Reports don't stop changing once they're released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.":1,"DBAs tend to approach their jobs in a backward fashion—from databases to tables to the data in those tables. A better approach is to start at the bottom and build your way up. In this session, you'll learn about records, stored on pages, grouped in extents, assigned by allocation bitmaps, with Index Allocation Map (IAM) pages and allocation units that span partitions and file groups. We'll cover byte swapping and bitmaps, and we'll touch on decoding hex and binary. You'll come away with a full understanding of database internals.":1,"To get peak performance from your SQL Server instance, you need to ensure that the majority of your database calls reuse a previously compiled query plan.

We will start with an overview of how the plan cache works, which will help you identify the existing plans that aren't being reused—and more importantly, we'll show you how to reverse that behavior. Finally, we'll explore several options for dealing with situations in which you might not have control over how calls are made to the database.":1,"A practical way to derive business value from big data is to micro-target customers—but where do you begin? In this session, we will examine real data from one of the nation's largest cable TV providers and combine it with data from the 2010 census and other data sources. Then we'll walk through a demonstration of how to use Hadoop and the Microsoft BI stack with this integrated data to quickly and easily develop powerful analytics. We'll demystify the process of working with big data by showing you first how to gather and load the data into Hadoop, and then how to extract a subset of that data and apply data visualization to reveal insightful patterns that you can use to connect more effectively with customers.":1,"Dirty data is everywhere, and it's headed for a database near you. Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be difficult, but often the most challenging component of that process is the validation and cleanup of data. Information must be cleansed in such a way that it retains its original message and business value, while conforming to the expectations of the destination system(s). In this session, we will discuss some design patterns for addressing different types of dirty data using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). We'll review the various cleansing tools accessible from within SSIS, including native Integration Services components, T-SQL, and SSIS scripting. In addition, we'll briefly review the new SQL Server Data Quality Services and its integration with SSIS.

Probably not—but the real question is, why not? Is your disk subsystem too slow, are you lacking enough CPUs, or is it something else? Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) make it easy to capture and analyze the file and wait statistical information that's automatically provided by the SQL Server instance—so why not use them? In this session, we will explore how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which SQL Server performance bottlenecks are causing the most harm. This knowledge should be part of every DBA's arsenal—so come make it part of yours as well.":1,"An interval represents a set of values between some low and some high values. In reality, there are different kinds of intervals that you might need to represent in your database, such as temporal (e.g., sessions, appointments, periods of validity). To represent temporal intervals in SQL Server, most people use two attributes holding the lower and upper points in time. You also might need to detect relations between intervals, such as overlap (e.g., \"return all contracts that were active during an input period represented by the inputs @lower and @upper\"). Some of the classic querying methods that are used to provide answers for such requests suffer from fundamental optimization problems. This session explains the existing optimization problems, presents solutions for those problems that can be applied in SQL Server, and describes the potential for additions to SQL Server that could improve interval treatment in the future.":1,"Securing your data is becoming increasingly important for data professionals. This session will cover the encryption features available in SQL Server to help you better secure data. Transparent Data Encryption, symmetric keys, asymmetric keys, and hashing functions will be covered in a number of demos.":1,"Do you dread handing your T-SQL code over for review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your code? In this demo-heavy session, we will take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL code. You'll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top-down design isn't the best approach to writing T-SQL. You'll learn why implicit conversions slow down queries and how to leverage simple techniques to minimize the performance effect of explicit conversions.

Setup has changed little, but then there's the \"Core or not?\" question. In 2012, though, the next question is \"So does Server 2012 have a GUI at all?\" The answer is \"Sure...four GUIs in fact, counting Server Core.\" There's still something called Server Manager, but it's completely different from the Server Managers we've seen since Windows Server 2003 SP1.The biggest change in server management is, however, not the all-new Server Manager. That title has to go to the tenfold increase in PowerShell tools. And from that point, there's the constant need to keep an eye on things and tweak what needs tweaking. With 2012, though, there are so many more ways to keep things running, and who better to explain those things than Windows expert and bestselling author Mark Minasi.":1,"One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment.

In mobile, instead, sometimes it seems that we’re looking for solutions without having first clarified what the problem is. Mobile, however, is a term that is quickly getting obsolete replaced by the term device. Any solution that involves mobile devices should be planned for a multitude of devices. This basic fact changes the approach to the design of the presentation layer (and to a good extent, also the application layer) putting the user experience on top of everything and, at least for new systems, taking precedence over domain and infrastructure. In this demo-laden workshop, we’ll first focus on multi-view client-side aspects such as Responsive Web Design and related frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS. Next, we will identify possible pitfalls of Responsive Web Design and ways to work around them.

Setup has changed little, but then there's the \"Core or not?\" question. In 2012, though, the next question is \"So does Server 2012 have a GUI at all?\" The answer is \"Sure...four GUIs in fact, counting Server Core.\" There's still something called Server Manager, but it's completely different from the Server Managers we've seen since Windows Server 2003 SP1.The biggest change in server management is, however, not the all-new Server Manager. That title has to go to the tenfold increase in PowerShell tools. And from that point, there's the constant need to keep an eye on things and tweak what needs tweaking. With 2012, though, there are so many more ways to keep things running, and who better to explain those things than Windows expert and bestselling author Mark Minasi.":1,"One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment.

Devices based on iOS and Android constitute more than 90% of the marketplace. RIM continues to be dominant in the business area across the world. With Windows Phone, Nokia will grow on a worldwide basis. At the same time, web development is clearly a tremendous driver of applications, both on the public Internet and on private networks. How can developers target these various mobile platforms with web technologies? Developers can write web applications that take advantage of each mobile platform, but that is a lot of work. This session will provide an overview of mobile web development with HTML5 and ASP.NET.":1,"This session is a hands-on introduction to web application security threats using the OWASP Top 10 list of potential security flaws. Focusing on the Microsoft platform with examples in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC), we will go over some of the common techniques for writing secure code in the light of the OWASP Top 10 list. In this code-centric talk, we will discuss the security features built into ASP.NET and MVC (e.g., cross-site request forgery tokens, secure cookies) and how to leverage them to write secure code. The web application security risks that will be covered in this presentation include injection flaws, cross-site scripting, broken authentication and session management, insecure direct object references, cross-site request forgery, security misconfiguration, insecure cryptographic storage, failure to restrict URL access, insufficient transport layer protection, and unvalidated redirects and forwards.":1,"Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a great addition to a developer’s toolbox. It provides SQL-like syntax and vocabulary to each of the languages, which can be used to query data sources. LINQ can be used to query a wide array of data sources.

Even if you have never come close to developing a game before, you will walk away from this session with the tools you need to jump into game development head first—and have fun doing it.":1,"SignalR is one of the latest components of the ASP.NET runtime, but it can do a lot more than just web. Come learn how you can build a real-time web application with minimal heavy lifting, without needing to learn another large framework. Then, take those lessons and use nearly identical syntax to give Modern Apps, Windows Azure Worker Roles running in the cloud, and other types of applications real-time HTTP functionality. The SignalR abstraction is a shift in how you think about web programming and in what's possible across a multitude of platforms and environments, and this session gets you started quickly with simple demonstrations that walk you through all the major capabilities of the #1 most followed open-source C# project on GitHub that grew to become the latest trick in the ASP.NET developer tool chest.":1,"We keep hearing about how fantastic Office 365 and Exchange Online are—but are they really? Do they suit everyone? In this session, we will uncover and explain the differences between the various hosted Exchange options and what they mean to customers in real-world deployments.":1,"With the release of SharePoint 2013, Microsoft has dramatically changed the rules for SharePoint developers. The introduction of the new app development model is intended to essentially eliminate the development of full-trust and sandboxed solutions for SharePoint. For developers, the situation is both intriguing and concerning. Many SharePoint developers have spent a decade mastering the intricacies of the full-trust model, but the app model forbids the use of the server-side object model. On the positive side, the app model opens up new and exciting possibilities for development. In this full-day workshop, you'll learn to develop apps for both on-premises installations and SharePoint online using various hosting models. You'll learn to access major workloads through the client-side object model and REST. You'll also learn about the new app security model and how to publish your apps. Attendees will leave the workshop ready to develop great SharePoint 2013 apps.":1,"Think you know the upgrade story? SharePoint 2010 is a much larger and more complex system to upgrade than its predecessors. And Microsoft has added new tools and removed some longstanding techniques used in prior upgrades. Based on dozens of upgrades and months of practice with SharePoint 2013, we’ll show you how to plan, execute, and manage an upgraded SharePoint 2013 environment, with plenty of live demos along the way. Afterward, you'll know the upgrade story and be ready to take advantage of the powerful capabilities for information workers that SharePoint 2013 has added.":1,"Do you know what counters, statistics, events, and other information you should be collecting on a regular basis to properly monitor your SQL Server instances? Do you know where your current bottlenecks really are or how to even look for them? Are you proactive or reactive when it comes to performance? In this session, we will cover the key areas to monitor regarding the database, server, and hardware to get the biggest bang for your buck. See how a little bit of effort up front can lead to a much better understanding of your database environment and put you in a great position to spot potential issues before they become real trouble. Each of the scripts and demos can be utilized immediately in your own environment. You will come away with a fundamental understanding of the most common bottlenecks affecting SQL Server performance and have a much better foothold on tackling the issues that you find.":1,"You’re agile. You write user stories. Now what? The next step is often to turn those user stories into executable tests that can help you validate the proper behavior of your complex software systems. Behavior-driven development (BDD) is the engine that can help drive this process in your project. In this session, we'll begin with a series of simple user stories and demonstrate how the BDD process supports codifying them into a series of \"executable specifications\" that can be used to validate the proper functionality of a complex software system. At first, we'll work without the overhead of so-called \"BDD Frameworks\" to demonstrate the important BDD concepts, but then we'll investigate how and when you might use various \"BDD Frameworks\" to offload some of the repetitive work often involved in the BDD process.

Do you know where your current bottlenecks really are or how to even look for them? Are you proactive or reactive when it comes to performance? In this session, we will cover the key areas to monitor regarding the database, server, and hardware to get the biggest bang for your buck. See how a little bit of effort up front can lead to a much better understanding of your database environment and put you in a great position to spot potential issues before they become real trouble. Each of the scripts and demos can be utilized immediately in your own environment. You will come away with a fundamental understanding of the most common bottlenecks affecting SQL Server performance and have a much better foothold on tackling the issues that you find.":1,"As a DBA or database developer, you typically undergo a number of learning phases when it comes to new T-SQL features. You usually start by learning the logical aspects of the feature, then practical uses and optimization. With time, you identify best practices, discover more advanced aspects of optimization, and find more creative ways to use the feature. The more experience you have with a feature, the more interesting uses you discover. Great examples are the APPLY operator and the ROW_NUMBER function. The newer the feature, the more discoveries that are still being realized. Good examples are the new and enhanced window functions. This seminar covers querying and query tuning enhancements in the latest major releases of SQL Server concerning new T-SQL features such as window functions, sequences, OFFSET/FETCH, MERGE, grouping sets, date and time types and functions, APPLY, pivoting and unpivoting, CTEs, indexing improvements, and others.":1,"This session provides an introduction to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for report developers who have no prior experience with the product. We explain how to use the development tools effectively, how to present and enhance data in a report, and how to create dynamic reports. Even if you already have some experience with SSRS, this session explores aspects of SSRS that are unintuitive and aren't well-documented, providing you with the opportunity to expand your skills and make the most of the reporting tool. In a jam-packed day of discussions and demonstrations applicable to SQL Server 2008 and later, you'll learn how to use a tablix effectively to design the layout of data with creative groupings, how to use expressions to display data or change the behavior of a report in practical ways, how to use report parameters with and without query parameters, how to use data visualization features, how to add interactivity to reports, and more!":1,"Update your troubleshooting skills and techniques by leveraging Microsoft’s latest debugging and performance tools specifically designed for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Soak in the knowledge and experience while you gain hands-on practice with your own laptop as you learn how to analyze BSODs (Blue Screen of Death), server hangs, and performance issues. Utilize free state-of-the-art tools from Microsoft, such as the new Windows 2012 Performance Toolkit, as you isolate performance bottlenecks in hands-on labs. Investigate real-world case studies while you learn debugging techniques to identify failing software drivers and hardware components. Leave this workshop with the knowledge and confidence you’ll need to resolve your most challenging issues for years to come! To maximize your learning experience, please bring your own laptop for practice labs. Your laptop should contain at least 2GB of free space for tools and lab materials. Power strips will be provided.":1,"System Center Orchestrator is the foundation of System Center and quite literally allows any process to be completely automated across any number of systems in the data center and even beyond into the cloud. It can be quite daunting to get started and determine the right way to create runbooks that can be reused in the future. In this mastering event, participants will learn the key concepts of how runbooks actually work, best practices for creating runbooks, and advanced troubleshooting techniques.":1,"In this pre-conference workshop, you will learn how to be effective in the Exchange Management Shell (EMS), even if you have little to no PowerShell experience. The command syntax in PowerShell can be intimidating at first, but once you understand some simple core concepts, you can vastly maximize your efficiency. Learn the techniques used to automate routine tasks and solve common problems that Exchange administrators face on a regular basis. Finally discover how to deal with the common pitfalls and stumbling blocks that arise when working with EMS. When you walk away, you’ll be ready to automate tasks in your own Exchange environment, armed with clear code samples that provision multiple recipients, make changes in bulk, generate advanced reports, and much more. Don’t let point and click administration slow you down any longer.":1,"The expert presenters will cover the following topics: Architectural principles and patterns: SOLID principles, OWASP threats, Data Access patternsQuick 20 Year History of Web Site Architecture Review: Request/Response Architecture, HTTP Fundamentals, AJAX, HTML5, Mobile and Modern Browsers, Rising User Experience Expectations - Speed, Interactivity, Animations, etc.A Simple SPA - Introduce Concept of View Swapping Backend is important: SQL Modelling, Comparing No-SQL databases, best practices for scalabilityUsing a JavaScript Template to Generate Markup: Quick Intro to Using JavaScript Templates, A Dive into Handlebars, Retrieving JSON and Dynamically Create HTML, Stuffing Content in Storage: localStorage, IndexDB, Review How to Offload Markup to Storage, Use Markup &amp; Templates On-Demand Leverage Storage to Minimize Network Traffic: Local data before AJAX call, eview the jQuery way, Review using reqwest (ajax micro library), Adding Offline Support Create an end to end SPA SEO: Tactics to Keep Search Engines Happy":1,"ASP.NET Web API is the de facto framework for building HTTP-based services in the .NET ecosystem. With its WCF and MVC lineage, Web API brings to the table better architecture, easier configuration, increased testability, and as always, it's customizable from top to bottom. But to properly use Web API it is not enough to get familiar with its architecture and API, you also need to really understand what HTTP is all about. HTTP is the most common application layer protocol in the world, and yet, not many web developers are familiar with HTTP concepts such as of chunking, caching, and persisted connections. ":1,"Join the UC Architects in a live recorded session as they debate the state of Exchange, Lync, and anything else to do with Microsoft collaboration technology. The Architects always have some surprising guests along to cause a little disruption and this session will be no difference. Come hear some unvarnished opinions about what’s right and what’s not with Exchange, how third party vendors are building some good add-on devices for Lync, whether “the service” is really living up to Microsoft’s expectations, and what’s hot at Connections.":1,"Yes, they’re at it again – those Microsoft rascals somehow got the idea that you weren’t so happy about Windows 8, and so Sometime Very Soon we’ll see a brand new version of Windows on the desktop and, even better, on the server! Code-named “Windows Blue” (no, not after the screen by that name – this baby’s rock-solid, or so they say), and at least at a first glance, it offers some fairly nice improvements to Microsoft’s flagship OS. But how good – or bad – IS it? Are we getting the Start Button back? Will we have to go to the cloud, or is there some on-premises goodness waiting for us Server folks? Well, the answer is… heck, you’re just going to have to come to the talk and find out when Windows’ Chief Simplifier of the Complex, Mark Minasi, reveals all!":1,"Exchange 2013 introduced some significant architectural changes from prior releases; as a result, the process for sizing an on-premises deployment has also changed. In this session, we will discuss both the art and the science behind properly sizing an Exchange 2013 deployment. The methods used to generate the official sizing guidelines will be explained, because the speaker was directly involved in this process. We will discuss what is included in the guidelines, and more importantly what is not included—because this is where the art comes into play. The latest official sizing calculator will be demonstrated, including an overview of changes since the 2010 version.":1,"When it comes to SQL Server, one of the biggest requests you hear is \"How can I make my queries run faster?\" The first step in that process is understanding the Query Optimizer—which begins with knowing the rules. The way our queries are written directly affects our output. In this session, we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and gain a better understanding of how the SQL Server Query Optimizer works.":1,"So you've developed a whiz-bang SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and . . . nothing happens—or it moves very slowly. Or perhaps you have packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

The 14 points originally provided by Steve Souders' research several years ago are just the starting point. Today there is so much more to consider. How do we manage data, handle markups, reduce data usage to the bare minimum, work offline, and provide rich animations and other moments of user delight? I will demonstrate how little things can add up to mean a lot, show you how to test and debug performance bugs, and leave you with some tools and techniques to make you look like a hero to your company’s CFO!":1,"In this app-to-app world, more and more people want to have their favorite application on both their phone and tablet. No matter whether they are identical apps or companion apps, it makes sense to be on both platforms. In this session, we will discuss the strategies needed to build both a Windows Phone app and a Windows 8 app. We will discuss the use of design patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and the use of Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) to share the most amount of code between applications.":1,"In this session, you’ll learn to use some of the latest HTML5 and ASP.NET APIs to create an application that includes many of the cross-cutting concerns important to a typical line-of-business application. During the dissection, you’ll learn to build a Bootstrap-based HTML5 offline application that is supported by an ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC)/Web API/Entity Framework Code-First backend, which enforces security, handles exceptions, and applies validation on the client and server. If you’re building web apps for businesses, this session is for you.":1,"SignalR is one of the latest components of the ASP.NET runtime, but it can do a lot more than just web. Come learn how you can build a real-time web application with minimal heavy lifting, without needing to learn another large framework. Then, take those lessons and use nearly identical syntax to give Modern Apps, Windows Azure Worker Roles running in the cloud, and other types of applications real-time HTTP functionality. The SignalR abstraction is a shift in how you think about web programming and in what's possible across a multitude of platforms and environments, and this session gets you started quickly with simple demonstrations that walk you through all the major capabilities of the #1 most followed open-source C# project on GitHub that grew to become the latest trick in the ASP.NET developer tool chest.":1,"Creating great software isn't like construction. It's more like gardening. In this session, you'll learn about important software gardening concepts such as soil, water, seeds, light, pruning, insecticide, weeding, and more. Along the way, you'll see processes, concepts, tools, and techniques that you can use in your software gardening project. By applying the ideas presented in this session, your software will be lush, green, and vibrant. This session has often been named \"best of Code Camp\" by attendees.":1,"Software is complex because it's called to model the complexity of real-world processes. In addition, inconsistent requirements, pet technologies, and methodologies that never make the last mile help prepare the ground for software disasters. This session examines the mechanics of software projects and patterns that may prevent a system from growing in an uncontrolled fashion. As a developer, you'll likely recognize common patterns that you've seen and learn ways to smooth their otherwise deep impact.":1,"Many developers have seen the Task Parallel Library APIs for concurrent applications, but have only played around with toy examples. In this session, you'll see how to extract concurrency and parallelism from seemingly impossible situations, how to gain scalability from lock-free code, and how to analyze real-world parallel applications with profilers to see the precise benefits gained from parallelization.":1,"With an install base of 500 million users, Microsoft Office is a well-established productivity and collaboration platform embraced by enterprises across the globe.

Part of the presentation will highlight building Outlook solutions and teaching tips, tricks and best practices as learned by someone with over a decade of experience in the field.":1,"Web applications have gotten complicated lately. Advances in JavaScript engines, HTML5, and CSS3 support mean that we can build some extremely impressive client-side web applications. In the past, one thing that has held client-side web development back was lack of development and testing tools. No longer is that an issue, as all modern browsers support a rich set of debugging tools. These tools go way beyond console.log or even setting a break point. Memory profiling, waterfall charts, and API emulations are just some of the common features. JavaScript unit testing frameworks have also advanced to a level that makes it easy for developers to build a strong set of tests. This session will review various browser developer tools and testing frameworks so attendees can start making better web applications.":1,"Usually a solution is sought for a clear and well-defined problem. In mobile, instead, sometimes it seems that we’re looking for solutions without having first clarified what the problem is. Mobile, however, is a term that is quickly getting obsolete replaced by the term device. Any solution that involves mobile devices should be planned for a multitude of devices. This basic fact changes the approach to the design of the presentation layer (and to a good extent, also the application layer) putting the user experience on top of everything and, at least for new systems, taking precedence over domain and infrastructure. In this demo-laden workshop, we’ll first focus on multi-view client-side aspects such as Responsive Web Design and related frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS. Next, we will identify possible pitfalls of Responsive Web Design and ways to work around them. In doing so, we’ll introduce server-side feature detection and device capabilities.":1,"":1,"You have more servers to manage and less time to do so. You're writing scripts to automate management tasks, but the scripts still take time to run.

The session will also introduce several third-party tools that further enhance the platform to enable true enterprise-class content lifecycle management.":1,"DBAs tend to approach their jobs in a backward fashion—from databases to tables to the data in those tables. A better approach is to start at the bottom and build your way up. In this session, you'll learn about records, stored on pages, grouped in extents, assigned by allocation bitmaps, with Index Allocation Map (IAM) pages and allocation units that span partitions and file groups. We'll cover byte swapping and bitmaps, and we'll touch on decoding hex and binary. You'll come away with a full understanding of database internals.":1,"You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn't it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you'll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mockups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. Reports don't stop changing once they're released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn't it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.":1,"An interval represents a set of values between some low and some high values. In reality, there are different kinds of intervals that you might need to represent in your database, such as temporal (e.g., sessions, appointments, periods of validity). To represent temporal intervals in SQL Server, most people use two attributes holding the lower and upper points in time. You also might need to detect relations between intervals, such as overlap (e.g., \"return all contracts that were active during an input period represented by the inputs @lower and @upper\"). Some of the classic querying methods that are used to provide answers for such requests suffer from fundamental optimization problems. This session explains the existing optimization problems, presents solutions for those problems that can be applied in SQL Server, and describes the potential for additions to SQL Server that could improve interval treatment in the future.":1,"This session will cover Hyper-V best practices regarding hardware, Server Core, clusters, security, performance, backup, versions, and management. Following these best practices will help ensure that your Hyper-V environment is fast, stable, and secure. Often poor performance and VM instability are directly related to not following the best practices in a virtualized environment. You'll also learn how to avoid pitfalls that can negatively affect your virtualization environment. Often with a few critical changes, even the most poorly configured virtualization environment can be transformed into a fast, stable computing platform.":1,"Exchange has matured into a flexible, scalable, and reliable product. However, running it at scale isn't without challenges.

We’ll also discuss how to use maintenance windows and task sequences to model complex scenarios.":1,"If you've ever had a Kerberos or SSPI context error, then you won't want to miss this session. SQL Server has a large surface area, and Active Directory can influence a big part of it. We will discuss AD DNS configuration, Group Policy Objects, Kerberos (of course), and how all of them affect SQL Server. By the end of the session you'll have a checklist of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work.":1,"You might be surprised at some of the new features Microsoft has added to their free MDT 2012 U1. For starters the Windows ADK replaced the Windows AIK. So what does that mean for you? The Windows ADK tools can assess the performance of your images (startup, shutdown, hibernation and resume and more) and ensure energy efficiency optimization (Go Green), they can also help you identify issues with your images prior to deployment. MDT 2012 introduced Group Policy Packs, but there are no GPO Packs (by default) for Windows 8 or Server 2012. Rhonda will show you how to build your own in 5 minutes or less. Then, Find out why everyone is talking about UEFI support and GPT partitions. Without a doubt the two most important aspects of deploying OSs is automation and customization because every organization has unique challenges and requirements. From running PowerShell scripts as a task during deployments to the User Driven Interface (UDI) which allows you to completely design your deployments even prompting for information during a deployment to automate which task sequence runs to a complete Zero Touch Installation. Saving the best for last – the true Rock Star of this session is the integration of System Center Orchestrator. Orchestrator Runbooks allow you to monitor and automate tasks during a deployment.

If you do, what are your options? In this session, we will discuss the different load balancing options and the caveats of each option. Some real-life examples and demos will help you determine which solution is right for you.":1,"The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best-designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage, have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Unfortunately, the DBA usually gets the blame for any performance issues that crop up later. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD and gives you the tools and resources to make better hardware selection decisions to support SQL Server OLTP workloads.":1,"In this SQLRally #3-rated session, we will discuss Central Management Server and how it can help you manage a diverse environment.

Do you want extra fries with that order?":1,"Server 2012 comes with a real treasure trove of useful new tools, but none of those tools are of any value if you don't know how to install them, start them up, and point them where you want them to go. Setup has changed little, but then there's the \"Core or not?\" question. In 2012, though, the next question is \"So does Server 2012 have a GUI at all?\" The answer is \"Sure...four GUIs in fact, counting Server Core.\" There's still something called Server Manager, but it's completely different from the Server Managers we've seen since Windows Server 2003 SP1.The biggest change in server management is, however, not the all-new Server Manager. That title has to go to the tenfold increase in PowerShell tools. And from that point, there's the constant need to keep an eye on things and tweak what needs tweaking. With 2012, though, there are so many more ways to keep things running, and who better to explain those things than Windows expert and bestselling author Mark Minasi.":1,"Windows Intune delivers management as a service for internet connected users. In this session, we will share the new features and demonstrate functionalities delivered in the latest service release of Windows Intune.":1,"Microsoft timed the release of Exchange 2013, Lync 2013, and SharePoint 2013 for the same time window, in large part because these products are more integrated with each other than previous versions have been. Lync and Exchange together offer a wealth of functionality, including instant messaging and presence integration inside Outlook Web App, high-resolution contact photos, and the new Unified Contact Store for consolidating Lync and Exchange contacts.

Advances in JavaScript engines, HTML5, and CSS3 support mean that we can build some extremely impressive client-side web applications. In the past, one thing that has held client-side web development back was lack of development and testing tools. No longer is that an issue, as all modern browsers support a rich set of debugging tools. These tools go way beyond console.log or even setting a break point. Memory profiling, waterfall charts, and API emulations are just some of the common features. JavaScript unit testing frameworks have also advanced to a level that makes it easy for developers to build a strong set of tests. This session will review various browser developer tools and testing frameworks so attendees can start making better web applications.":1,"Usually a solution is sought for a clear and well-defined problem. In mobile, instead, sometimes it seems that we’re looking for solutions without having first clarified what the problem is. Mobile, however, is a term that is quickly getting obsolete replaced by the term device. Any solution that involves mobile devices should be planned for a multitude of devices. This basic fact changes the approach to the design of the presentation layer (and to a good extent, also the application layer) putting the user experience on top of everything and, at least for new systems, taking precedence over domain and infrastructure. In this demo-laden workshop, we’ll first focus on multi-view client-side aspects such as Responsive Web Design and related frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS. Next, we will identify possible pitfalls of Responsive Web Design and ways to work around them. In doing so, we’ll introduce server-side feature detection and device capabilities.":1,"":1,"You have more servers to manage and less time to do so.

We'll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.":1,"An interval represents a set of values between some low and some high values. In reality, there are different kinds of intervals that you might need to represent in your database, such as temporal (e.g., sessions, appointments, periods of validity). To represent temporal intervals in SQL Server, most people use two attributes holding the lower and upper points in time. You also might need to detect relations between intervals, such as overlap (e.g., \"return all contracts that were active during an input period represented by the inputs @lower and @upper\"). Some of the classic querying methods that are used to provide answers for such requests suffer from fundamental optimization problems. This session explains the existing optimization problems, presents solutions for those problems that can be applied in SQL Server, and describes the potential for additions to SQL Server that could improve interval treatment in the future.":1,"This session will cover Hyper-V best practices regarding hardware, Server Core, clusters, security, performance, backup, versions, and management. Following these best practices will help ensure that your Hyper-V environment is fast, stable, and secure.

Do you want extra fries with that order?":1,"Server 2012 comes with a real treasure trove of useful new tools, but none of those tools are of any value if you don't know how to install them, start them up, and point them where you want them to go. Setup has changed little, but then there's the \"Core or not?\" question. In 2012, though, the next question is \"So does Server 2012 have a GUI at all?\" The answer is \"Sure...four GUIs in fact, counting Server Core.\" There's still something called Server Manager, but it's completely different from the Server Managers we've seen since Windows Server 2003 SP1.The biggest change in server management is, however, not the all-new Server Manager. That title has to go to the tenfold increase in PowerShell tools. And from that point, there's the constant need to keep an eye on things and tweak what needs tweaking. With 2012, though, there are so many more ways to keep things running, and who better to explain those things than Windows expert and bestselling author Mark Minasi.":1,"Windows Intune delivers management as a service for internet connected users. In this session, we will share the new features and demonstrate functionalities delivered in the latest service release of Windows Intune.":1,"Microsoft timed the release of Exchange 2013, Lync 2013, and SharePoint 2013 for the same time window, in large part because these products are more integrated with each other than previous versions have been.
